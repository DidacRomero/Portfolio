lead_text: 'GATE is a 3D game engine we built with a colleague. The engine features all necesary systems for a 3D game engine and a Lua based scripting system. At the end of the semester this engine was chosen by the teacher as the game engine to develop The Witcher: Ties of Destiny, but we switched to another game engine that a friend had been improving over the holidays which had an almost Unity like resource manager. The scripting system was used and improved during the whole development of the 3D game The Witcher: Ties of Destiny.'
