lead_text: 'In this super fun local multiplayer Battle Royale inspired by Final Fantasy Tactics I was a programmer. I coded some parts of the gameplay of the game but for the most part I was developing the support systems for the game and helped my teammates when something wasn't working. I also made some research and implementations which weren't finally added or used such as a bush Fog of War system or a fade in fade out system for any kind of sprite.'
